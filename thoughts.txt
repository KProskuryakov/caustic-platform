What's the game about?

Let's start with a simplistic vvvvvv clone

Maybe something a bit better

Current collision rules that I would like to do

Basic:
Standing and running on the ground.
Jumping, moving in the air while jumping
Grip walls when you press the arrow against them
You can climb walls by holding jump and going left/right
You can also grip and slide on ceilings by holding jump
